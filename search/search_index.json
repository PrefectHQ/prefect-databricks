Parameters: Name Type Description Default databricks_credentials 'DatabricksCredentials' Credentials to use for authentication with Databricks. required name str An optional name for the job, e.g. A multitask job . 'Untitled' tags Dict A map of tags associated with the job. These are forwarded to the cluster as cluster tags for jobs clusters, and are subject to the same limitations as cluster tags. A maximum of 25 tags can be added to the job, e.g. {\"cost-center\": \"engineering\", \"team\": \"jobs\"} None tasks List ['models.JobTaskSettings'] A list of task specifications to be executed by this job, e.g. [ { \"task_key\": \"Sessionize\", \"description\": \"Extracts session data from events\", \"depends_on\": [], \"existing_cluster_id\": \"0923-164208-meows279\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.Sessionize\", \"parameters\": [\"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/data.json\"], }, \"libraries\": [{\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/Sessionize.jar\"}], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\", \"description\": \"Ingests order data\", \"depends_on\": [], \"job_cluster_key\": \"auto_scaling_cluster\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.OrdersIngest\", \"parameters\": [\"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/order-data.json\"], }, \"libraries\": [{\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/OrderIngest.jar\"}], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Match\", \"description\": \"Matches orders with user sessions\", \"depends_on\": [ {\"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\"}, {\"task_key\": \"Sessionize\"}, ], \"new_cluster\": { \"spark_version\": \"7.3.x-scala2.12\", \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\", \"spark_conf\": {\"spark.speculation\": True}, \"aws_attributes\": { \"availability\": \"SPOT\", \"zone_id\": \"us-west-2a\", }, \"autoscale\": {\"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 16}, }, \"notebook_task\": { \"notebook_path\": \"/Users/user.name@databricks.com/Match\", \"base_parameters\": {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": \"35\"}, }, \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, ] None job_clusters List ['models.JobCluster'] A list of job cluster specifications that can be shared and reused by tasks of this job. Libraries cannot be declared in a shared job cluster. You must declare dependent libraries in task settings, e.g. [ { \"job_cluster_key\": \"auto_scaling_cluster\", \"new_cluster\": { \"spark_version\": \"7.3.x-scala2.12\", \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\", \"spark_conf\": {\"spark.speculation\": True}, \"aws_attributes\": { \"availability\": \"SPOT\", \"zone_id\": \"us-west-2a\", }, \"autoscale\": {\"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 16}, }, } ] None email_notifications 'models.JobEmailNotifications' An optional set of email addresses that is notified when runs of this job begin or complete as well as when this job is deleted. The default behavior is to not send any emails. Key-values: - on_start: A list of email addresses to be notified when a run begins. If not specified on job creation, reset, or update, the list is empty, and notifications are not sent, e.g. [\"user.name@databricks.com\"] - on_success: A list of email addresses to be notified when a run successfully completes. A run is considered to have completed successfully if it ends with a TERMINATED life_cycle_state and a SUCCESSFUL result_state. If not specified on job creation, reset, or update, the list is empty, and notifications are not sent, e.g. [\"user.name@databricks.com\"] - on_failure: A list of email addresses to be notified when a run unsuccessfully completes. A run is considered to have completed unsuccessfully if it ends with an INTERNAL_ERROR life_cycle_state or a SKIPPED , FAILED , or TIMED_OUT result_state. If this is not specified on job creation, reset, or update the list is empty, and notifications are not sent, e.g. [\"user.name@databricks.com\"] - no_alert_for_skipped_runs: If true, do not send email to recipients specified in on_failure if the run is skipped. None timeout_seconds int An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. The default behavior is to have no timeout, e.g. 86400 . None schedule 'models.CronSchedule' An optional periodic schedule for this job. The default behavior is that the job only runs when triggered by clicking \u201cRun Now\u201d in the Jobs UI or sending an API request to runNow . Key-values: - quartz_cron_expression: A Cron expression using Quartz syntax that describes the schedule for a job. See Cron Trigger for details. This field is required, e.g. 20 30 * * * ? . - timezone_id: A Java timezone ID. The schedule for a job is resolved with respect to this timezone. See Java TimeZone for details. This field is required, e.g. Europe/London . - pause_status: Indicate whether this schedule is paused or not, e.g. PAUSED . None max_concurrent_runs int An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job. Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently. This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters. This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job\u2019s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won\u2019t kill any of the active runs. However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs. This value cannot exceed 1000. Setting this value to 0 causes all new runs to be skipped. The default behavior is to allow only 1 concurrent run, e.g. 10 . None git_source 'models.GitSource' This functionality is in Public Preview. An optional specification for a remote repository containing the notebooks used by this job's notebook tasks. Key-values: - git_url: URL of the repository to be cloned by this job. The maximum length is 300 characters, e.g. https://github.com/databricks/databricks-cli . - git_provider: Unique identifier of the service used to host the Git repository. The value is case insensitive, e.g. github . - git_branch: Name of the branch to be checked out and used by this job. This field cannot be specified in conjunction with git_tag or git_commit. The maximum length is 255 characters, e.g. main . - git_tag: Name of the tag to be checked out and used by this job. This field cannot be specified in conjunction with git_branch or git_commit. The maximum length is 255 characters, e.g. release-1.0.0 . - git_commit: Commit to be checked out and used by this job. This field cannot be specified in conjunction with git_branch or git_tag. The maximum length is 64 characters, e.g. e0056d01 . - git_snapshot: Read-only state of the remote repository at the time the job was run. This field is only included on job runs. None format str Used to tell what is the format of the job. This field is ignored in Create/Update/Reset calls. When using the Jobs API 2.1 this value is always set to 'MULTI_TASK' , e.g. MULTI_TASK . None access_control_list List ['models.AccessControlRequest'] List of permissions to set on the job. None Returns: Type Description Dict [ str , Any ] A dict of the response. API Endpoint: /2.1/jobs/create API Responses: Response Description 200 Job was created successfully. 400 The request was malformed. See JSON response for error details. 401 The request was unauthorized. 500 The request was not handled correctly due to a server error.

A maximum of 25 tags can be added to the job, e.g. ``` {\"cost-center\": \"engineering\", \"team\": \"jobs\"} ``` tasks: A list of task specifications to be executed by this job, e.g. ``` [ { \"task_key\": \"Sessionize\", \"description\": \"Extracts session data from events\", \"depends_on\": [], \"existing_cluster_id\": \"0923-164208-meows279\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.Sessionize\", \"parameters\": [\"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/data.json\"], }, \"libraries\": [{\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/Sessionize.jar\"}], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\", \"description\": \"Ingests order data\", \"depends_on\": [], \"job_cluster_key\": \"auto_scaling_cluster\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.OrdersIngest\", \"parameters\": [\"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/order-data.json\"], }, \"libraries\": [{\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/OrderIngest.jar\"}], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Match\", \"description\": \"Matches orders with user sessions\", \"depends_on\": [ {\"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\"}, {\"task_key\": \"Sessionize\"}, ], \"new_cluster\": { \"spark_version\": \"7.3.x-scala2.12\", \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\", \"spark_conf\": {\"spark.speculation\": True}, \"aws_attributes\": { \"availability\": \"SPOT\", \"zone_id\": \"us-west-2a\", }, \"autoscale\": {\"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 16}, }, \"notebook_task\": { \"notebook_path\": \"/Users/user.name@databricks.com/Match\", \"base_parameters\": {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": \"35\"}, }, \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, ] ``` job_clusters: A list of job cluster specifications that can be shared and reused by tasks of this job. Libraries cannot be declared in a shared job cluster. You must declare dependent libraries in task settings, e.g. ``` [ { \"job_cluster_key\": \"auto_scaling_cluster\", \"new_cluster\": { \"spark_version\": \"7.3.x-scala2.12\", \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\", \"spark_conf\": {\"spark.speculation\": True}, \"aws_attributes\": { \"availability\": \"SPOT\", \"zone_id\": \"us-west-2a\", }, \"autoscale\": {\"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 16}, }, } ] ``` email_notifications: An optional set of email addresses that is notified when runs of this job begin or complete as well as when this job is deleted. The default behavior is to not send any emails. Key-values: - on_start: A list of email addresses to be notified when a run begins. If not specified on job creation, reset, or update, the list is empty, and notifications are not sent, e.g. ``` [\"user.name@databricks.com\"] ``` - on_success: A list of email addresses to be notified when a run successfully completes. A run is considered to have completed successfully if it ends with a `TERMINATED` `life_cycle_state` and a `SUCCESSFUL` result_state. If not specified on job creation, reset, or update, the list is empty, and notifications are not sent, e.g. ``` [\"user.name@databricks.com\"] ``` - on_failure: A list of email addresses to be notified when a run unsuccessfully completes. A run is considered to have completed unsuccessfully if it ends with an `INTERNAL_ERROR` `life_cycle_state` or a `SKIPPED`, `FAILED`, or `TIMED_OUT` result_state. If this is not specified on job creation, reset, or update the list is empty, and notifications are not sent, e.g. ``` [\"user.name@databricks.com\"] ``` - no_alert_for_skipped_runs: If true, do not send email to recipients specified in `on_failure` if the run is skipped. timeout_seconds: An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. The default behavior is to have no timeout, e.g. `86400`. schedule: An optional periodic schedule for this job. The default behavior is that the job only runs when triggered by clicking \u201cRun Now\u201d in the Jobs UI or sending an API request to `runNow`. Key-values: - quartz_cron_expression: A Cron expression using Quartz syntax that describes the schedule for a job. See [Cron Trigger](http://www.quartz- scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) for details. This field is required, e.g. `20 30 * * * ?`. - timezone_id: A Java timezone ID. The schedule for a job is resolved with respect to this timezone. See [Java TimeZone](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html) for details. This field is required, e.g. `Europe/London`. - pause_status: Indicate whether this schedule is paused or not, e.g. `PAUSED`. max_concurrent_runs: An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job. Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently. This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters. This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job\u2019s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won\u2019t kill any of the active runs. However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs. This value cannot exceed 1000\\. Setting this value to 0 causes all new runs to be skipped. The default behavior is to allow only 1 concurrent run, e.g. `10`. git_source: This functionality is in Public Preview. An optional specification for a remote repository containing the notebooks used by this job's notebook tasks. Key-values: - git_url: URL of the repository to be cloned by this job. The maximum length is 300 characters, e.g. `https://github.com/databricks/databricks-cli`. - git_provider: Unique identifier of the service used to host the Git repository. The value is case insensitive, e.g. `github`. - git_branch: Name of the branch to be checked out and used by this job. This field cannot be specified in conjunction with git_tag or git_commit. The maximum length is 255 characters, e.g. `main`. - git_tag: Name of the tag to be checked out and used by this job. This field cannot be specified in conjunction with git_branch or git_commit. The maximum length is 255 characters, e.g. `release-1.0.0`. - git_commit: Commit to be checked out and used by this job. This field cannot be specified in conjunction with git_branch or git_tag. The maximum length is 64 characters, e.g. `e0056d01`. - git_snapshot: Read-only state of the remote repository at the time the job was run. This field is only included on job runs. format: Used to tell what is the format of the job. This field is ignored in Create/Update/Reset calls. When using the Jobs API 2.1 this value is always set to `'MULTI_TASK'`, e.g. `MULTI_TASK`. access_control_list: List of permissions to set on the job.

A maximum of 25 tags can be added to the job, e.g. ``` {\"cost-center\": \"engineering\", \"team\": \"jobs\"} ``` - tasks: A list of task specifications to be executed by this job, e.g. ``` [ { \"task_key\": \"Sessionize\", \"description\": \"Extracts session data from events\", \"depends_on\": [], \"existing_cluster_id\": \"0923-164208-meows279\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.Sessionize\", \"parameters\": [ \"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/data.json\", ], }, \"libraries\": [ {\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/Sessionize.jar\"} ], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\", \"description\": \"Ingests order data\", \"depends_on\": [], \"job_cluster_key\": \"auto_scaling_cluster\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.OrdersIngest\", \"parameters\": [ \"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/order-data.json\", ], }, \"libraries\": [ {\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/OrderIngest.jar\"} ], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Match\", \"description\": \"Matches orders with user sessions\", \"depends_on\": [ {\"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\"}, {\"task_key\": \"Sessionize\"}, ], \"new_cluster\": { \"spark_version\": \"7.3.x-scala2.12\", \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\", \"spark_conf\": {\"spark.speculation\": True}, \"aws_attributes\": { \"availability\": \"SPOT\", \"zone_id\": \"us-west-2a\", }, \"autoscale\": { \"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 16, }, }, \"notebook_task\": { \"notebook_path\": \"/Users/user.name@databricks.com/Match\", \"base_parameters\": { \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": \"35\", }, }, \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, ] ``` - job_clusters: A list of job cluster specifications that can be shared and reused by tasks of this job. Libraries cannot be declared in a shared job cluster. You must declare dependent libraries in task settings, e.g. ``` [ { \"job_cluster_key\": \"auto_scaling_cluster\", \"new_cluster\": { \"spark_version\": \"7.3.x-scala2.12\", \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\", \"spark_conf\": {\"spark.speculation\": True}, \"aws_attributes\": { \"availability\": \"SPOT\", \"zone_id\": \"us-west-2a\", }, \"autoscale\": { \"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 16, }, }, } ] ``` - email_notifications: An optional set of email addresses that is notified when runs of this job begin or complete as well as when this job is deleted. The default behavior is to not send any emails. - timeout_seconds: An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. The default behavior is to have no timeout, e.g. `86400`. - schedule: An optional periodic schedule for this job. The default behavior is that the job only runs when triggered by clicking \u201cRun Now\u201d in the Jobs UI or sending an API request to `runNow`. - max_concurrent_runs: An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job. Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently. This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters. This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job\u2019s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won\u2019t kill any of the active runs. However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs. This value cannot exceed 1000\\. Setting this value to 0 causes all new runs to be skipped. The default behavior is to allow only 1 concurrent run, e.g. `10`. - git_source: This functionality is in Public Preview. An optional specification for a remote repository containing the notebooks used by this job's notebook tasks. - format: Used to tell what is the format of the job. This field is ignored in Create/Update/Reset calls. When using the Jobs API 2.1 this value is always set to `'MULTI_TASK'`, e.g. `MULTI_TASK`. Returns: A dict of the response. <h4>API Endpoint:</h4> `/2.1/jobs/reset` <h4>API Responses:</h4> | Response | Description | | --- | --- | | 200 | Job was overwritten successfully. | | 400 | The request was malformed.

The default behavior is to not send any emails. - timeout_seconds: An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. The default behavior is to have no timeout, e.g. 86400 . - schedule: An optional periodic schedule for this job. The default behavior is that the job only runs when triggered by clicking \u201cRun Now\u201d in the Jobs UI or sending an API request to runNow . - max_concurrent_runs: An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job. Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently. This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters. This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job\u2019s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won\u2019t kill any of the active runs. However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs. This value cannot exceed 1000. Setting this value to 0 causes all new runs to be skipped. The default behavior is to allow only 1 concurrent run, e.g. 10 . - git_source: This functionality is in Public Preview. An optional specification for a remote repository containing the notebooks used by this job's notebook tasks. - format: Used to tell what is the format of the job. This field is ignored in Create/Update/Reset calls. When using the Jobs API 2.1 this value is always set to 'MULTI_TASK' , e.g. MULTI_TASK . None fields_to_remove List Remove top-level fields in the job settings. Removing nested fields is not supported. This field is optional, e.g. [\"libraries\", \"schedule\"] None Returns: Type Description Dict [ str , Any ] A dict of the response.

This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters. This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job\u2019s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won\u2019t kill any of the active runs. However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs. This value cannot exceed 1000\\.

None timeout_seconds int An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. The default behavior is to have no timeout, e.g. 86400 . None idempotency_token str An optional token that can be used to guarantee the idempotency of job run requests. If a run with the provided token already exists, the request does not create a new run but returns the ID of the existing run instead. If a run with the provided token is deleted, an error is returned. If you specify the idempotency token, upon failure you can retry until the request succeeds. Databricks guarantees that exactly one run is launched with that idempotency token. This token must have at most 64 characters. For more information, see How to ensure idempotency for jobs , e.g. 8f018174-4792-40d5-bcbc-3e6a527352c8 .

This field is required, e.g. 11223344 . None new_settings 'models.JobSettings' The new settings for the job. Any top-level fields specified in new_settings are completely replaced. Partially updating nested fields is not supported. Changes to the field JobSettings.timeout_seconds are applied to active runs. Changes to other fields are applied to future runs only. Key-values: - name: An optional name for the job, e.g. A multitask job . - tags: A map of tags associated with the job. These are forwarded to the cluster as cluster tags for jobs clusters, and are subject to the same limitations as cluster tags. A maximum of 25 tags can be added to the job, e.g. {\"cost-center\": \"engineering\", \"team\": \"jobs\"} - tasks: A list of task specifications to be executed by this job, e.g. [ { \"task_key\": \"Sessionize\", \"description\": \"Extracts session data from events\", \"depends_on\": [], \"existing_cluster_id\": \"0923-164208-meows279\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.Sessionize\", \"parameters\": [ \"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/data.json\", ], }, \"libraries\": [ {\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/Sessionize.jar\"} ], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\", \"description\": \"Ingests order data\", \"depends_on\": [], \"job_cluster_key\": \"auto_scaling_cluster\", \"spark_jar_task\": { \"main_class_name\": \"com.databricks.OrdersIngest\", \"parameters\": [ \"--data\", \"dbfs:/path/to/order-data.json\", ], }, \"libraries\": [ {\"jar\": \"dbfs:/mnt/databricks/OrderIngest.jar\"} ], \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, { \"task_key\": \"Match\", \"description\": \"Matches orders with user sessions\", \"depends_on\": [ {\"task_key\": \"Orders_Ingest\"}, {\"task_key\": \"Sessionize\"}, ], \"new_cluster\": { \"spark_version\": \"7.3.x-scala2.12\", \"node_type_id\": \"i3.xlarge\", \"spark_conf\": {\"spark.speculation\": True}, \"aws_attributes\": { \"availability\": \"SPOT\", \"zone_id\": \"us-west-2a\", }, \"autoscale\": { \"min_workers\": 2, \"max_workers\": 16, }, }, \"notebook_task\": { \"notebook_path\": \"/Users/user.name@databricks.com/Match\", \"base_parameters\": { \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": \"35\", }, }, \"timeout_seconds\": 86400, \"max_retries\": 3, \"min_retry_interval_millis\": 2000, \"retry_on_timeout\": False, }, ] - job_clusters: A list of job cluster specifications that can be shared and reused by tasks of this job.

The default behavior is to not send any emails. - timeout_seconds: An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. The default behavior is to have no timeout, e.g. 86400 . - schedule: An optional periodic schedule for this job. The default behavior is that the job only runs when triggered by clicking \u201cRun Now\u201d in the Jobs UI or sending an API request to runNow . - max_concurrent_runs: An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job. Set this value if you want to be able to execute multiple runs of the same job concurrently. This is useful for example if you trigger your job on a frequent schedule and want to allow consecutive runs to overlap with each other, or if you want to trigger multiple runs which differ by their input parameters. This setting affects only new runs. For example, suppose the job\u2019s concurrency is 4 and there are 4 concurrent active runs. Then setting the concurrency to 3 won\u2019t kill any of the active runs. However, from then on, new runs are skipped unless there are fewer than 3 active runs. This value cannot exceed 1000. Setting this value to 0 causes all new runs to be skipped. The default behavior is to allow only 1 concurrent run, e.g. 10 . - git_source: This functionality is in Public Preview. An optional specification for a remote repository containing the notebooks used by this job's notebook tasks. - format: Used to tell what is the format of the job. This field is ignored in Create/Update/Reset calls. When using the Jobs API 2.1 this value is always set to 'MULTI_TASK' , e.g. MULTI_TASK .
